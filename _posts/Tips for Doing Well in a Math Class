Make a schedule. Expect to put in about 2 to 3 hours for every hour of class.

What do you during that time?
- Review your notes. If there is anything you do not understand, put a mark next to it and make a plan to ask about it.
- Work on homework. Ask yourself if you can do a similar problem if it were to show up on a test. Have your book and notes with you as you do the homework.
- If you have spent a decent amount of time on a homework problem and have made little to no progress, ask yourself:
  - What have I tried so far?
  - What progress have I made?
  - Where am I stuck? 
- Sometimes just articulating where you are stuck can help you get unstuck.
