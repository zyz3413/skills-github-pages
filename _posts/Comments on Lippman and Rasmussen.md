Here are some comments on the Precalculus book by Lippmann and Rasmussen. 

Chapter 1: Functions

Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation

Tables as Functions

p.4 Not every function can be represented by a table. This point should probably be made clearer.

Solving and Evaluating Functions

p.5 "Solving a function could produce more than one solution, since different inputs can produce the same output." This could use more explanation. The word "solution" has more than one meaning. In the context of solving equations, we are given an output and asked to find *all* inputs that correspond to that output. Each possible input is called a *solution*. This is *not* the same as ``the solution'' as in, "the answer to the problem." The authors never say what they mean by a "solution."

Graphs as Functions

p.6 There is a lack of precision regarding graphs and functions of graphs. At first, the authors clearly make a distinction between a graph and a function: "Oftentimes a graph of a relationship can be used to define a function." "Which of these graphs defines a function $y=f(x)$?" But a few lines later, they write, "Graph 1 is not a one-to-one function." So is a graph a function or not? 

p.7 The statement of the horizontal line test is ambiguous. "Draw horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line crosses the graph more than once, then the graph does not define a one-to-one function." What they mean is that if there is *any* horizontal line that crosses the graph more than once, the function is not one-to-one. They don't mean just the lines that you drew. Obviously it's not possible to draw every single line. So then what is the point of drawing horizontal lines through the graph? 

Formulas as Functions

p.8 "It is important to note that not every relationship can be expressed as a function with a formula." An example would be nice.

p.9 Example 12b. They have to check whether that is a solution to be sure it works. They write, "You can check your answer by using your solution in the original equation to see if your calculated answer is correct." But you *have* to in order to be sure that the number you found is actually a solution.

Basic Toolkit Functions

Section 1.2 Domain and Range

Domain and Range from Graphs

p.26 The way they define range is strange. They define it as "all possible outputs."  Like many of their definitions, this is too ambiguous and open to interpretation. They give an example with crude oil production. The range is the set of all *attained* outputs. You could ask, "Isn't it possible for the output to be some number that wasn't actually attained? Why wouldn't that be in the range if it's a possible output?"

p.28 "One divide by any value can never be 0..."

Piecewise Functions

p.29 "With a domain of all real numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, the absolute value can be defined as the magnitude or modulus of a number, a real number value regardless of sign, the size of the number, or the distance from 0 on the number line." What does this even mean? It makes no sense.

Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs

p.37 Is there an explanation of what the triangle means? 

p.39 There should be equals signs

Graphical Behavior of Functions

p. 40 Example 7. There is an issue with the description of increasing/decreasing. It is correct to say that the function is increasing on [1,3] and decreasing on [3,4]. The key thing is that we do not say that a function is increasing at a point. They write, "the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at $t=1,3,$ or $4$." 

The definition of local maximum and minima and extrema is OK, but there are issues with Example 8. They say that "there is local maximum at $t=8$." We don't actually know if there is a local maximum at $t=8$, because we don't know what happens in a neighborhood of $t=8$.

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions

Compoisition of Functions using Tables and Graphs

Composition using Formulas

Domain of Compositions

Decomposing Functions

Section 1.5 Transformations of Functions

Chapter 2: Linear Functions

Section 2.1 Linear Functions

p. 103, p.104 "$m$ is the constant rate of change of the function (also called slope)." Is that a definition? No, it's a theorem! So we shouldn't say that the constant rate of change is "also called the slope." It is a mathematical fact that the rate of change of a linear function is the same as the slope of the graph of the function.

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

p. 120 They say that two lines are parallel if the slopes are equal (or, if both lines are vertical). Is that a definition or a theorem?

p.120 The definition of perpendicular lines is not good. They say that the definition is that the lines are perpendicular if $m_1 m_2=-1$. What if you have a horizontal and a vertical line? Also, it is not a definition because in the preceding paragraph they write, "...one other interesting possibility is that the lines are perpendicular, which means the lines form a right angle... where they meet." And they say that "the slopes when multiplied together will equal $-1$" with no justification. Why is it true? The authors don't say.

Intersections of Lines

"The graphs of two lines will intersect if they are not parallel." This is true, but why? The authors don't say. This follows from the definition if we *define* parallel lines to be lines that don't intersect. 

Section 2.3 Modeling with Linear Functions

Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data

Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions

Important Features

p.150 Example 3. There is not enough explanation for how they got $f(x)=2|x-3|-2$.

Solving Absolute Value Equations

p.152 Ambiguity about what the horizontal/vertical intercepts are.

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

p.153 They go about solving inequalities in a different way. They don't rewrite it as a compound inequality without absolute value signs. But their method works.

Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions

Section 3.1 Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

p.159 definition of a power function. They say that a power function is a function that can be represented in the form $f(x)=x^p$ where $p$ is "a number." Is $x^{-2/3}$ a power function? The domain should be specified.

Characteristics of Power Functions

Polynomials

p.162 "Each of the $a_i$ constants are called coefficients and can be positive, negative, or zero, and be whole numbers, decimals, or fractions." It would be clearer to just say that they can be any real number.

p.163 "For any polynomial, the long run behavior of the polynomial will match the long run behavior of the leading term." There should be some justification for this. Again, the statement is not precise.

Short Run Behavior

p.164 There is a sloppiness when it comes to intercepts. They write, "Horizontal intercepts are also called zeros, or roots of the function." So are horizontal intercepts points or are they numbers? In example 6 below, the intercepts are points.

Section 3.2 Quadratic Functions

Short run Behavior: Vertex

p.167 "You probably noticed that all quadratics are related to transformations of the basic quadratic function $f(x)=x^2$." We didn't prove that.

Short run Behavior: intercepts

p.174 In deriving the quadratic formula, the authors make the familiar gap of taking square roots of both sides, without explaining what happens if $b^2-4ac<0$. They should say that the expression on the bottom of the page shows that if $b^2-4ac<0$, the equation has no real solutions. Then if $b^2-4ac \ge 0$, we are allowed to take square roots.

Section 3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions

Short run Behavior: Intercepts

p. 181 Example 1. Suddenly the horizontal intercepts are numbers, not points.

Graphical Behavior at Intercepts

Solving Polynomial Inequalities

Writing Equations using Intercepts

p.186 This uses the Factor Theorem, which they haven't discussed yet! In example 7,l how do we know that since $-3$ is a root, that $f(x)$ has a factor of $x+3$?

Section 3.5 Real Zeros of Polynomials

Section 3.6 Complex Zeros

Arithmetic on Complex Numbers

Complex Zeros of Polynomials

p.213 "First, the zeros ... are complex conjugates. This will always be the case when we find non-real zeros to a quadratic function with real coefficients." Why? There is no explanation given.

p.213 "A non-constant polynomial f with real or complex coefficients will have at least one real or complex zero." Are real numbers complex numbers or not? They should just say, "A nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients will have at least one complex zero." 

p.214 Same issue with their "Complex Factorization Theorem." They make it seem as though real numbers are not complex numbers.
