Here are some comments on the Precalculus book by Lippmann and Rasmussen. 

1.3 There is a good explanation of average rate of change.

p.37 Is there an explanation of what the triangle means? 

p.39 There should be equals signs

Graphical Behavior of Functions

The authors give a correct definition of increasing/decreasing functions.

There is an issue with the description of increasing/decreasing on page 40, example 7. It is correct to say that the function is increasing on [1,3] and decreasing on [3,4]. The key thing is that we do not say that a function is increasing at a point. They write, "the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at $t=1,3,$ or $4$." 

The definition of local maximum and minima and extrema is OK, but there are issues with Example 8. They say that "there is local maximum at $t=8$." We don't actually know if there is a local maximum at $t=8$, because we don't know what happens in a neighborhood of $t=8$.

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions

p.120 

The definition of perpendicular lines is not good. They say that the definition is that the lines are perpendicular if $m_1 m_2=-1$. What if you have a horizontal and a vertical line? Also, it is not a definition because in the preceding paragraph they write, "...one other interesting possibility is that the lines are perpendicular, which means the lines form a right angle... where they meet." And they say that "the slopes when multiplied together will equal $-1$" with no justification. Why is it true? The authors don't say.
