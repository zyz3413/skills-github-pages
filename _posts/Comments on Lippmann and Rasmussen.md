Here are some comments on the Precalculus book by Lippmann and Rasmussen. 

1.3 There is a good explanation of average rate of change.

p.37 Is there an explanation of what the triangle means? 

p.39 There should be equals signs

Graphical Behavior of Functions

The authors give a correct definition of increasing/decreasing functions.

There is an issue with the description of increasing/decreasing on page 40, example 7. It is correct to say that the function is increasing on [1,3] and decreasing on [3,4]. The key thing is that we do not say that a function is increasing at a point. They write, "the functijon is neither increasing nor decreasing at $t=1,3,$ or $4$."
