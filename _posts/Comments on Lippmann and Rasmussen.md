Here are some comments on the Precalculus book by Lippmann and Rasmussen. 

1.3 There is a good explanation of average rate of change.

p.37 Is there an explanation of what the triangle means? 

p.39 There should be equals signs

Graphical Behavior of Functions

The authors give a correct definition of increasing/decreasing functions.

There is an issue with the description of increasing/decreasing on page 40, example 7. It is correct to say that the function is increasing on [1,3] and decreasing on [3,4]. The key thing is that we do not say that a function is increasing at a point. They write, "the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at $t=1,3,$ or $4$." 

The definition of local maximum and minima and extrema is OK, but there are issues with Example 8. They say that "there is local maximum at $t=8$." We don't actually know if there is a local maximum at $t=8$, because we don't know what happens in a neighborhood of $t=8$.

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions

p.120 

The definition of perpendicular lines is not good. They say that the definition is that the lines are perpendicular if $m_1 m_2=-1$. What if you have a horizontal and a vertical line? Also, it is not a definition because in the preceding paragraph they write, "...one other interesting possibility is that the lines are perpendicular, which means the lines form a right angle... where they meet." And they say that "the slopes when multiplied together will equal $-1$" with no justification. Why is it true? The authors don't say.

Intersections of Lines

"The graphs of two lines will intersect if they are not parallel." This is true, but why? The authors don't say. This follows from the definition if we *define* parallel lines to be lines that don't intersect. 

Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions

Important Features

p.150 Example 3. There is not enough explanation for how they got $f(x)=2|x-3|-2$.

Solving Absolute Value Equations

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

They go about solving inequalities in a different way. They don't rewrite it as a compound inequality without absolute value signs. But their method works.

Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions

Section 3.1 Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

p.159 definition of a power function. They say that a power function is a function that can be represented in the form $f(x)=x^p$ where $p$ is "a number." Is $x^{-2/3}$ a power function? The domain should be specified.

Polynomials

p. 164 Short Run Behavior

There is a sloppiness when it comes to intercepts. They write, "Horizontal intercepts are also called zeros, or roots of the function." So are horizontal intercepts points or are they numbers? In example 6 below, the intercepts are points.

Section 3.2 Quadratic Functions

Short run Behavior: Vertex

Short run Behavior: intercepts

p.174 In deriving the quadratic formula, the authors make the familiar gap of taking square roots of both sides, without explaining what happens if $b^2-4ac<0$. They should say that the expression on the botto of the page shows that if $b^2-4ac<0$, the equation has no real solutions. Then if $b^2-4ac \ge 0$, we are allowed to take square roots.
