For students:

The fact is that in many places, much of your grade depends on how you do on a test. The first thing to know is that it's important to know the material well first. I am assuming that this is not a difficulty, so please refer elsewhere for tips on actually learning the material.

Assuming that, the key thing to keep in mind is that it's not enough to just show up knowing the material and then start doing the test. Think of a timed test like a job interview. Many of the questions are questions you can expect to answer, but some may be unfamiliar and you'll need to think about those more. Either way, you shouldn't just know the material and then show up to the test. It takes *practice.* 

Here are some things students have said after they are disappointed with their test score:

"I understand the concepts, but I still didn't do well on the test."

"I am getting 100% on the homework, but I still didn't do well on the test."

"I did well on practice tests, but I still didn't do well on the test."

"I know how to do the problem, but I just didn't get it right on the test."

What is going on? What is going on is that these students *assumed* that their performance on other things (homework, past tests, their sense of how well they understand the material) would somehow carry over and translate to good performance on the timed test. These students probably did better on the test than students who didn't do these things -- if a student doesn't know how to do the homework, they'll probably have a much harder time on the homework than if they did. Still, the explanation for how it's possible for students to be doing OK with the material but not on the test has to do with how they prepared for the test. Think about what you will be asked to do on a test. You will have a certain amount of time to answer several questions. So in order to predict how well you might do, you should practice answering common questions.

One way to get a good idea of what kind of questions you will be asked is to look at old exams. This is a valuable source of exam problems. However, be aware that doing well on these is not a guarantee that you will do well on the actual test. Think about what you are expected to know as a big pile. In previous tests, the instructor picks from this big pile. But if you only know how to do the problems that were picked, then you will probably have difficulty with questions you haven't seen before.

Sources of common exam problems:
- old exams
- exams from other universities
- problems from worksheets, quizzes, and homework
- problems in a textbook (you can check answers with the back of the book, but be aware that there are occasionally errors in the answers in the back)
