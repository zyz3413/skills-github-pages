At least in the US there are two kinds of multivariable calculus courses. One is a course that does not require linear algebra. This type of course only does things for R^2 and R^3 and is largely computational. Some books for this are:

- Calculus by Stewart. Overall, this is a solid book, and the last several chapters (starting with the chapter on vectors until the end) gives a standard treatment of multivariable calculus. 
- Calculus by Briggs and Cochran. Similar to Stewart. These two books give great pictures.

There are other books that state theorems for R^n and may include proofs. Some books for this are:

- Vector Calculus by Marsden and Tromba. This is my personal preference.
- Vector Calculus by Colley. Some people like this book, but I find it pretty confusing, and I really dislike the graphics. The pictures in Stewart and Briggs-Cochran are much better.
- Multivariable Calculus by Shimamoto. I haven't read this book carefully, but it looks like a good book, with lots of exercises.

Some more advanced books are
- Advanced Calculus of Several Variables by Edwards. This is a Dover book, readily affordable. This is definitely a book that requires some sophistication to understand. It doesn't hold the reader's hand. Expect to see lots of theorems and proofs with few examples. For these kinds of books, you have to make up your own examples to understand how the theory works. This book states things in a lot of generality, which is very nice, but it may be too advanced. For example, it defines manifolds, which goes beyond what most courses in multivariable calculus would cover.
- Advanced Calculus by Buck. This is an outstanding book. It ties together a lot of concepts. One thing I like is how it reviews the theory of a single variable and it connects it with the general theory in R^n.

Here are some books that could be used for multivariable calculus that I am less familiar with:
- Advanced Calculus by Fitzpatrick
- A First Course in Analysis by John B. Conway
