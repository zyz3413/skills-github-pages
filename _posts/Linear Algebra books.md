Lay, Linear Algebra

Strang, Linear Algebra and Its Applications. I think this book is out of print, but I prefer it to his Introduction to Linear Algebra.

For a more theoretical book, Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence, or Linear Algebra Done Wrong (online manuscript, unpublished) by Treil.

Linear Algebra by Bretscher is a good choice for an honors textbook.

Matrices and Linear Algebra by Schneider and Barker is old but good. It would be tough going for independent study. Their notation is not typical.

Books appropriate for a second course would be

Matrix Mathematics by Garcia and Horn

Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze. This book is an old book. It's more suitable for math majors who are just learning the theory.

Linear Algebra Done Right by Axler
