There really is no shortage of linear algebra textbooks. Linear algebra is a prerequisite for many more advanced courses. I would say that the main thing to get out of such a course is how matrices work. Familiarity with matrix operations and matrix algebra, and familiarity with the main concepts. For a first course, the main concepts are: solving linear systems, linear combinations and span, linear independence, linear mappings and linearity, vector space, basis, dimension, rank, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, and orthogonal projection. On a more advanced level, quadratic forms, the spectral theorem, diagonalization, change of coordinates, and the matrix of a transformation with respect to different bases.

These books are good choices for an introductory textbook for primarily non-math majors:
- Linear Algebra by Lay, Lay, McDonald. An old edition just by Lay is also good.
- Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Strang. I think this book is out of print, but I prefer it to his Introduction to Linear Algebra.
You probably will not go through the entire book in a first course in linear algebra. If you are going into a STEM field that requires linear algebra, the later chapters would be a useful reference.

I am less familiar with these books, but they seem like decent choices for an introductory book:
- Linear Algebra with Applications by Leon
- Introduction to Linear Algebra by Johnson, Riess, Arnold

Books for an Honors, more theory-based course:
- Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence
- Linear Algebra Done Wrong (online manuscript, unpublished) by Treil.
- Linear Algebra by Bretscher is a good choice for an honors textbook.
- Linear Algebra by Meckes and Meckes
- Linear Algebra by Axler

Matrices and Linear Algebra by Schneider and Barker is old but good. It would be tough going for independent study. Their notation is not typical.

Books appropriate for a second course:
- Matrix Mathematics by Garcia and Horn
- Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze
